* As stated in JWT.io. The JSON Web Token which is commonly know as JWT is an open source (RFC-7519), that defines
a compact and Self contained way for securely transmitting the information between parties as a JSON object.

* The information is digitally signed, meaning there is an understanding between to agree upon.
* HMAC, RSA or ECDSA are couple of algorithms that are used for creating digital signatures.

Structure of a JWT

{Base64 encoded header}.{Base64 encoded payload}.{Signature}

* Header contains, Algorithm and Token type.
* Payload(claims) - Payloads carry claims, user and additional data such as token expiry.
                  - There are 3 types of claims- Registered, Public and Private.
* Signature - Computed from the Header, payload and a secret.
            - An algorithm to generate the signature.
            - Digitally signed using a secret string only known to the developer.
